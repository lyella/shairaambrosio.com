## An overview of the project.

Hello, and welcome to my personal blog and portfolio website! My name is Shaira, and I am a Frontend Developer.

This website was created using Next.js, a popular React framework that allows for server-side rendering and automatic code splitting, resulting in lightning-fast load times and improved SEO.

Through this website, I aim to showcase my skills and experience as a developer, as well as provide a platform for sharing my thoughts and insights on the latest trends and technologies in the frontend development world.
