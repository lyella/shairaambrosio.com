## What is Flex Grid in CSS?

Flex Grid in CSS is a grid system that is built using Flexbox, a powerful layout tool in CSS. Flexbox allows developers to create flexible and responsive layouts by aligning and distributing space among items in a container. The Flex Grid system is designed to work with Flexbox, making it a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts.

## How Does Flex Grid in CSS Work?

Flex Grid in CSS works by using a set of CSS classes that define the layout of a grid. These classes can be applied to any container element, such as a div or a section, to create a flexible and responsive grid system. The grid is defined using rows and columns, with each column taking up a certain percentage of the container's width.

One of the key features of Flex Grid in CSS is the ability to easily change the layout based on screen size. By using media queries, developers can define different layouts for different screen sizes, allowing the grid to adjust to the size of the device.

```html
<div class="wrap">
  <div class="box box2"></div>
  <div class="box box1"></div>
  <div class="box box3"></div>
  <div class="box box4"></div>
  <div class="box box4"></div>
</div>
```

The **HTML** code has a div with a class of "wrap" which contains five divs with a class of "box". Each of these boxes has a unique class name ranging from "box1" to "box4".

```css
.wrap {
  padding: 1%;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.wrap:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}

.box {
  float: left;
  margin: 1%;
}

.box1 {
  width: 31.33%;
  padding-bottom: 31.33%;
  background: #c7f7e3;
}

.box2 {
  float: right;
  width: 64.66%;
  padding-bottom: 14.66%;
  background: #ff928b;
}

.box3 {
  width: 31.33%;
  padding-bottom: 14.66%;
  background: #ffe4e1;
}

.box4 {
  width: 31.33%;
  padding-bottom: 6.33%;
  background: #b5e7a0;
}

@media (max-width: 414px) {
  .box2,
  .box4 {
    width: 98%;
    padding-bottom: 31.33%;
  }
  .box1,
  .box3 {
    width: 48%;
    padding-bottom: 48%;
  }
}
```

The **CSS** code applies styles to the HTML elements. The ".wrap" class sets padding and a border around the container. The ":after" pseudo-class adds a block element after the container and clears any floated elements.

The ".box" class sets the float and margin for all boxes.

Each box has its own unique class, and the ".box1", ".box2", ".box3", and ".box4" classes set the width, padding-bottom, and background color of the boxes.

The "@media" rule applies specific styles to the boxes when the screen size is less than or equal to 414px. In this case, ".box2" and ".box4" take up 98% of the screen width with a padding-bottom of 31.33%, while ".box1" and ".box3" take up 48% of the screen width with a padding-bottom of 48%.

## Why is Flex Grid in CSS Important?

- Flex Grid in CSS is important because it simplifies the process of creating responsive layouts. With traditional grid systems, developers often need to write custom CSS to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. Flex Grid in CSS, on the other hand, makes this process much simpler by using Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.

- Flex Grid in CSS is also popular because it's easy to learn and use. The CSS classes used to define the grid are straightforward and easy to understand, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.

Flex Grid in CSS is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts in web development. By leveraging the power of Flexbox, Flex Grid makes it easy for developers to create flexible and responsive layouts that adjust to the size of the device.
